# Project Charter: Patient Data Analysis

## 1. Why is this analysis needed?
This analysis is needed to identify trends in patient admissions, diagnoses, and hospital resource utilization. The insights will help improve patient care, optimize hospital operations, and enhance financial decision-making.

## 2. What business questions do stakeholders want answered?
- What are the most common diagnoses and procedures?
- How does patient demographic data impact hospital visits?
- What are the trends in hospital stay duration and costs?
- Are there seasonal patterns in patient admissions?
- How can we improve resource allocation based on patient data?

## 3. Are there any KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) to measure?
- **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)**
- **Readmission Rates**
- **Patient Mortality Rates**
- **Cost per Patient Visit**
- **Bed Occupancy Rate**
- **Percentage of High-Risk Patients**

## 4. Is this the only dataset, or do we need to combine it with others?
Currently, the analysis is based on the provided `patients.csv` dataset. However, additional datasets (e.g., billing records, patient feedback, electronic health records) may be required for deeper insights.

## 5. Who owns the data (IT, Business, Finance, etc.)?
- **Primary Owner:** IT & Clinical Data Management Team
- **Contributors:** Business Intelligence, Research Team, Finance Department

## 6. What format is preferred for final outputs (dashboard, report, presentation)?
- **Interactive Dashboard** (Power BI, Tableau)
- **PDF Reports** with Key Findings
- **Executive Presentation** (PowerPoint)
- **Raw Data Summaries** for Advanced Users

## 7. Should the analysis be one-time or ongoing (monthly, quarterly)?
The analysis should be **ongoing**, with reports generated on a **monthly** basis for trend monitoring and operational decision-making.

## 8. Are there any data access restrictions (e.g., HIPAA compliance for patient data)?
- Yes, patient data is subject to **HIPAA compliance** and must be handled securely.
- Data access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII) must be anonymized before analysis.

## 9. Whatâ€™s the project deadline?
- **Initial findings & report:** [Insert Date]
- **Full dashboard implementation:** [Insert Date]
- **Ongoing analysis & improvements:** Monthly Updates

## 10. When are progress updates expected?
- **Weekly team check-ins** to discuss progress & roadblocks.
- **Bi-weekly stakeholder updates** via email or presentations.
- **Monthly report submissions** for review.

## 11. Are there any dependencies (e.g., waiting for more data)?
- Additional data sources may be required for in-depth analysis.
- IT needs to validate data integrity before full analysis.
- Compliance team must approve data handling procedures before sharing insights.
